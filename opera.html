    <h3>Act III</h3> 
    <h4>SCENE - Courtyard of Castle Adamant</h4>
    <h5> The Walls and Courtyard of Castle Adamant. Melissa, SachaRissa, and ladies discovered, armed with battleaxes.</h5>
    <h5>RECITATIVE</h5>
    <h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>  <p> I like your spirit, girls!  We have to meet  Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
                Wear naught but what is necessary to Preserve your dignity before their eyes,
                And give your limbs full play. </p>

    <h6 class="Bla">Bla:</h6>  <p>   One moment, ma'am, Here is a paradox we should not pass
                Without inquiry.  We are prone to say "This thing is Needful — that, Superfluous"—
                Yet they invariably co-exist!  We find the Needful comprehended in
                The circle of the grand Superfluous,  Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
                Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful. These singular considerations are— </p>
    
    <h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6> <p>  Superfluous, yet not Needful — so you see The terms may independently exist.
                (To Ladies) Women of Adamant, we have to show That women, educated to the task,
                Can meet Man, face to face, on his own ground, And beat him there.  Now, let us set to work;
                Where is our lady surgeon? </p>

    <h6 class="Sac">Sac:</h6>  <p>   Madam, here! </p>

    <h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>  <p> We shall require your skill to heal the wounds
                Of those that fall. </p>
                
                          <p> (Alarmed)  </p>

    <h6 class="Sac">Sac.:</h6>   <p>  What, heal the wounded? </p>

    <h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>   <p>   Yes! </p>

    <h6 class="Sac">Sac:</h6>   <p> And cut off real live legs and arms? </p>

    <h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>     <p>   Of course! </p>

    <h6 class="Sac">Sac:</h6>     <p> I wouldn't do it for a thousand pounds!</p>

    <h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>   <p>Why, how is this?  Are you faint-hearted, girl? You've often cut them off in theory! </p>

    <h6 class="Sac">Sac:</h6>   <p>   In theory I'll cut them off again With pleasure, and as often as you like,
                But not in practice. </p>

    <h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>  <p>  Coward!  Get you hence, I've craft enough for that, and courage too,
                I'll do your work!  My fusiliers, advance!,   Why, you are armed with axes!  Gilded toys!
                Where are your rifles, pray? </p>

    <h6 class="Chl">Chl:</h6>   <p> Why, please you, ma'am,  We left them in the armoury, for fear
                That in the heat and turmoil of the fight, They might go off! </p>

    <h6 class="Pri"> Pri:</h6>    <p>"They might!"  Oh, craven souls! Go off yourselves!  Thank heaven I have a heart
                That quails not at the thought of meeting men; I will discharge your rifles!  Off with you!</p>

                <p>"I Built upon a Rock"</p>

    <h6 class="Pri">Pri: </h6> <p>I built upon a rock,
                 But ere Destruction's hand
                 Dealt equal lot
                 To Court and cot,
                 My rock had turn'd to sand!
                    I leant upon an oak,
                 But in the hour of need,
                 Alack-a-day,
                 My trusted stay
                 Was but a bruis-ed reed!
                    A bruis-ed reed!
                 Ah faithless rock,
                 My simple faith to mock!
                 Ah trait'rous oak,
                 Thy worthlessness to cloak,
                 Thy worthlessness to cloak!

                 I drew a sword of steel
                  But when to home and hearth
                 The battle's breath
                 Bore fire and death,
                   My sword was but a lath!
                  I lit a beacon fire,
                But on a stormy day
                  Of frost and rime,
                 In wintertime,
                   My fire had died away,
                  Had died away!
                 Ah, coward steel,
                 That fear can un-anneal!
                 False fire indeed,
                 To fail me in my need,
                 To fail me in my need!</p>
