<h6 class="Ada">Ada:</h6> <p> Please you, ma'am, the band Do not feel well, and can't come out today!</p>
    
<h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>  <p>  Why, this is flat rebellion!  I've no time
        To talk to them just now. But, happily,
        I can play several instruments at once,
        And I will drown the shrieks of those that fall
        With trumpet music, such as soldiers love!
        How stand we with respect to gunpowder?
        My Lady Psyche — you who superintend
        Our lab'ratory — are you well prepared
        To blow these bearded rascals into shreds?. </p>

<h6 class="Psy">Psy:</h6>  <p>   Why, madam— </p>

<h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6> <p>  Well? </p>

<h6 class="Psy">Pys:</h6>  <p>   Let us try gentler means.
    We can dispense with fulminating grains
    While we have eyes with which to flash our rage!
    We can dispense with villainous saltpetre
    While we have tongues with which to blow them up!
    We can dispense, in short, with all the arts
    That brutalize the practical polemist! </p>

<h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>  <p class="Direction"> (Contemptuously) </p>
<p>     I never knew a more dispensing
    chemist!
Away, away — I'll meet these men alone
Since all my women have deserted me!</p>

<p class="Direction"> (Exeunt all but Princess, singing
    refrain of
    "Please you, do not hurt us",
     pianissimo.) </p>
    
<h6 class="psy">psy:</h6>   <p>  Well? </p>

<h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>   <p>   So fail my cherished plans — so fails my faith—
                                  And with it hope, and all that comes of hope!</p>

<h6 class="Psy">Psy:</h6>   <p> And cut off real live legs and arms? </p>

<h6 class="Pri">Pri:</h6>     <p>   Of course! </p>
